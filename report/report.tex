\chapter{Scenario Discussion}

%In this DSL, a requirements model comprises a number of requirements, test-cases
%and team members. There are two types of requirements: customer requirements and
%system requirements. Each requirement has an identifier and a textual description.
%Requirements can be hierarchically decomposed (e.g. requirement A cannot be satis-
%fied, unless requirements B and C are satisfied) and can also be in conflict with other
%requirements (e.g. only one of requirements A and B can be satisfied). Each test-case
%has a description and can be used to verify one or more technical requirements. Some
%additional properties include:
%? The identifier of each requirement is unique
%? The textual description of a requirement is at least 10 characters long
%? Customer requirements cannot be in conflict with system requirements (and
%vice-versa)
%? Customer requirements can be decomposed into technical requirements, but not
%the other way round
%? Each customer requirement needs to be decomposed into at least one technical
%requirement
%? Each test-case needs to be verifying at least one technical requirement
%? Each technical requirement needs originate from at least one customer require-
%ment
%? Each leaf requirement (i.e. requirement that is not further decomposed) has a
%"progress" field that records how much progress the development team has made
%towards satisfying it so far (e.g. 50%)
%? The progress of a non-leaf requirement is the average of the progress of the
%requirements it is decomposed into (e.g. if requirement A is decomposed into
%requirements B and C, where B and C are at 10% and 20% complete respectively,
%the progress of A is 15%)
%? Each requirement can be allocated to one or more team members
%? Requirements decomposition must be free of cycles

System requirements cannot be root nodes.

Customer requirements cannot be leaf nodes.

System requirements cannot be parents of customer requirements.

\chapter{Stuff eliminated by metamodel}
Customer requirements cannot be leaf nodes because they need to have at least one child.
